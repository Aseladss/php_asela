## Database Setup

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=php_asela
DB_USERNAME=root

Next up, we need to create the database which will be grabbed from the ```DB_DATABASE``` environment variable.
```
mysql;
create database php_asela;
exit;
```

Finally, make sure that you migrate your migrations.
```
php artisan migrate
```
